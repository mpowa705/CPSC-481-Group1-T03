# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Our Project is the Cooking Helper, it is an app that has its core based around being a cookbook, it's primary function is to provide our users with any recipe they need. On top of this, our app has other new features not found in other apps. Firstly, our app will have two search functions, one will be by recipe name, and the other by ingredients. Our ingredient search function will use two search bars, one for ingredients to include, one for ingredients to omit, to serve our users with restrictive diets better. Related to ingredients, should our user be missing any, we will provide a map to nearby stores which stock the respective missing ingredient. We expect our system to be used by anyone interested in cooking, whether experienced, or if they use our app to cook their first dish. We have kept this diversity within our clients in mind while designing this. We expect it to be used on mobile devices or laptops, and exclusively within a kitchen environment, again, the preparedness of the cook in their environment will vary user to user.

## Stakeholders and Users

Our stakeholders are first and foremost our users, their cooking experience is very much based on the quality of our system, and any changes we make will be primarily reflected through them. Secondly, we, the developers have a stake in this system as we put time and effort into it, as well as receiving the feedback for it. Other stakeholders include the store owners whose shops our app directs users to, as they will either see an increase or decrease in sales based on our success and inclusion of said store.

## User Research Methods

The three methods we chose were: Rapid ethnography, Fly-on-the-wall, and secondary research into other cooking apps and cooking instructions found on other platforms. We chose rapid ethnography and fly-on-the-wall for the same reason, we want to see the current state of users when they are interacting with available cooking helpers, to see if there is anything wrong with the current process, or if there is anything we could add that would significantly enhance the user experience. We chose our final method as secondary research because we feel it is very important, given the oversaturated cookbook industry, that we fully understand what is currently available, and the best way to do this is a simple dive into a search engine or app store.

I conducted one interview using the rapid ethnography method, I conducted this run with my little brother. I had him use the free app Yummly because it was the number two app on a "Best cooking app list" where number one wasn't free [1]. I had him choose the recipe he wanted to cook, and he chose Hot Dog, I asked him why he picked that and he said that he thought it would be the quickest and easiest thing to cook. He searched Hot Dog into the search function which must be accessed via a button ib the bottom of the screen, which he found almost immediately. After looking through his results, I asked him what he thought of them. He said he was very impressed by not only the amount of results but the variations between them. Eventually he scrolled back up and chose the first recipe on the list, which was titled "The Best Hot Dog", it was also the simplest looking one going by its picture according to our interviewee. it took him moments to gather the ingredients as they were very simple and immediately available (Buns, Weiner, and Condiments). Once the ingredients were gathered he clicked on the "View Directions" button, to which he noted that it was strange to have the directions and ingredients on two different pages. Once clicked, he was presented with an introductory few paragraphs, which weren't instructions but just background info on the dish. He noted that he was annoyed that he had to scroll through this unneccesary information about the dish before the recipe, once he reached the recipe, he noticed that the ingredients were listed again, and remarked on the unneccesity of the previous page. I prodded him to ask if the background info on the dish being placed after the recipe would have annoyed him less to which he responded yes, as then he could back out without having to go through it, as he said he would never read them. Cooking the dish was rather trivial and the directions were concise and easy to follow according to him. From this interview, we've learned that although the app we tested was overall well recieved, avoiding redundancy of information is something that we cannot ignore, as our users will not.
