# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Our Project is the Cooking Helper, it is an app that has its core based around being a cookbook, its primary function is to provide our users with any recipe they need. On top of this, our app has other new features not found in other apps. Firstly, our app will have two search functions, one will be by recipe name, and the other by ingredients. Our ingredient search function will use two search bars, one for ingredients to include, one for ingredients to omit, to serve our users with restrictive diets better. Related to ingredients, should our user be missing any, we will provide a map to nearby stores which stock the missing ingredient. We expect our system to be used by anyone interested in cooking, whether experienced or if they use our app to cook their first dish. We have kept this diversity within our clients in mind while designing this. We expect it to be used on mobile devices or laptops, and exclusively within a kitchen environment, again, the preparedness of the cook in their environment will vary user to user. Our app will only be offered in English.

## Stakeholders and Users

Our stakeholders are first and foremost our users, their cooking experience is very much based on the quality of our system, and any changes we make will be primarily reflected through them their experience will vary greatly. Secondly, we, the developers have a stake in this system as we put time and effort into it, as well as receiving the feedback for it, as we made the system we have the highest familiarity with it. Other stakeholders include the store owners whose shops our app directs users to, as they will either see an increase or decrease in sales based on our success and inclusion of said store. Other stakeholders include cooking tutorial makers and investors who may not even neccesarily use our system, but still gain or lose from the quality of our app.

## User Research Methods

The three methods we chose were: Rapid ethnography, Fly-on-the-wall, and secondary research into other cooking apps and cooking instructions found on other platforms. We chose rapid ethnography and fly-on-the-wall for the same reason, we want to see the current state of users when they are interacting with available cooking helpers, to see if there is anything wrong with the current process, or if there is anything we could add that would significantly enhance the user experience. We chose our final method as secondary research because we feel it is very important, given the oversaturated cookbook industry, that we fully understand what is currently available, and the best way to do this is a simple dive into a search engine or app store.

### User Research Method 1:

I conducted one interview using the rapid ethnography method, I conducted this run with my eighteen year old little brother, who is a rather inexperienced cook. I had him use the free app Yummly because it was the number two app on a "Best cooking app list" where number one wasn't free [1]. I had him choose the recipe he wanted to cook, and he chose Hot Dog, I asked him why he picked that and he said that he thought it would be the quickest and easiest thing to cook. He searched Hot Dog into the search function which must be accessed via a button at the bottom of the screen, which he found almost immediately. After looking through his results, I asked him what he thought of them. He said he was very impressed by not only the amount of results but the variations between them. Eventually, he scrolled back up and chose the first recipe on the list, which was titled "The Best Hot Dog", it was also the simplest looking one going by its picture according to our interviewee. it took him moments to gather the ingredients as they were very simple and immediately available (Buns, Weiner, and Condiments). Once the ingredients were gathered he clicked on the "View Directions" button, to which he noted that it was strange to have the directions and ingredients on two different pages. Once clicked, he was presented with an introductory few paragraphs, which weren't instructions but just background info on the dish. He noted that he was annoyed that he had to scroll through this unnecessary information about the dish before the recipe, once he reached the recipe, he noticed that the ingredients were listed again, and remarked on the unnecessity of the previous page. I prodded him to ask if the background information on the dish being placed after the recipe would have annoyed him less to which he responded yes, as then he could back out without having to go through it, as he said he would never read them. Cooking the dish was rather trivial and the directions were concise and easy to follow according to him.

### User Research Method 2:

For the observation method(fly on the wall), I presented the user with a free existing cooking app, called “Food Network: In the Kitchen”, within a tablet device and had the user pick a recipe and prepare it as I watched. Following the choosing of the recipe (a pasta dish), I noticed the user going over the ingredients page, and quickly organizing both available and non-specified ingredients. Since the user is a much older and a highly experienced cook, I also assumed the user being able to improvise and improve upon the recipe shown within the app. As a note, the given app didn’t contain extra suggestions or alternatives that would, in other cases, help or advise a novice cook. Similarly to the directions, the user was much more efficient with time management, mainly in the form of prepping. In this case, while the pasta and the sauce were cooking, the user chopped the necessary ingredients shortly before using them. Hence the user was able to complete the recipe under 25 minutes, unlike the reported 35 minutes within the cooking app. Although the user is experienced, some time saving directives would've been useful for a novice user as well. Thus, we can also note that the recipe directions from the chosen app are obsolete in some aspects. I also remarked the user omitting a few ingredients and directions, with the reasoning of it being an unhealthy way of cooking and to consume based on their experiences. I also noticed that the user periodically looked at the directions during the cooking procedure. Following this observation, the user summarized that the app was satisfactory, but in need of improvements. Despite only observing a single user using this IDEO method, I can say that diverse users will approach and react differently to a recipe in this cooking app. Therefore, our design for a cooking app will implement additional forms of suggestions, which will help ease any complications towards the user, while also maintaining simplicity.

### User Research Method 3:

Conducted by John Hall:

Secondary Research:

To gain some insight into what is available with regards to cooking apps, we conducted some secondary research to see what kinds of apps are available, what features they offer and browsed reviews of the app to see what people thought. There are multiple reasons why we chose this form of user research. There is a large amount of information available on the web creating apps and reviews that we could not do on our own. This allows us to quickly see what is available and get a sense of what's working and what is not. This allows us to pick the best ideas and fix problems seen in other apps of this nature. This complements our other interview and observation methods because we can compare what we saw with actual users to what we find online to see if the feedback matches. Secondary sources allow collecting of a large amount of information quickly but one of the drawbacks of the is that it can be very informative to have interacted with actual users because reviews can be biased. The multiple user research techniques allow us to get each of these perspectives.

We will now review our findings on the features of six highly rated cooking apps and online reviews of what these apps did poorly. 

The first app is BigOven (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/bigoven-350-000-recipes-and-grocery-list/id294363034?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). This app allows the user to have a grocery list, a daily meal planner as well as a recipe list that can be from the database or uploaded by the user. They also feature a search function that you to type in ingredients and it displays dishes that can be made with those ingredients. According to reviews (http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/home/best-meal-planning-software/bigoven-review/), this app is great for recipes and meal management but has limited shopping tools. 

Our second app is Food Network in the Kitchen (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/food-network-in-the-kitchen/id399072152?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). This app provides recipe lists, a dish search by category, how to videos, tips and substitutions for recipes, recipe ratings and reviews. From user reviews (https://www.amazon.com/Food-Network-In-the-Kitchen/product-reviews/B00C25OI36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1), the main problems are bugs and glitches with the software that frustrated people. 

The third app we reviewed is Allrecipes Dinner Spinner (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/allrecipes-dinner-spinner/id299515267?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). This app features a search for ingredients to include or exclude, swipe to like and create recommendations, save recipes and knows about nearby stores and what's on sale with recommendations for dishes with sale products. According to reviews (https://www.amazon.com/Allrecipes-com-Allrecipes-Dinner-Spinner/product-reviews/B004VOJT0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt_rgt?filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1), the ingredient search only allows a single ingredient which frustrated users. 

A fourth highly rated cooking app is Epicurious Recipe & Food Videos (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/epicurious-recipes-food-videos/id312101965?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). This app has recipes, cooking videos, shopping list, a smart kitchen timer and seasonal ingredients finder. According to the reviews (https://bestcompany.com/recipe-sites/company/epicurious/), recipes were not given a difficulty level so newer users found it challenging and other pieces of the user interface were unintuitive such as the meal planner being difficult to find.

Another app we reviewed with interesting features is Side Chef (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/sidechef-step-by-step-cooking/id905229928?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). This app features timers, ingredient specific instructional videos, voice commands, an ingredient wiki, functionality for browsing and rating recipes, uploading recipes and adjusting serving size. Interestingly, reviews said that while the voice command seemed like a valuable feature, it was not very intelligent and only responded to very simple commands like ''Next'', reducing its utility (http://blog.healthadvocate.com/2016/07/wellness-app-review-sidechef/). 

Our final reviewed app is FoodSwitch (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bupa.foodswitch&hl=en). This app allows the user to scan the bar code of food with a Smartphone and gives nutritional information. Reviews of this said that while this is a good idea, nutritional information was limited to energy, fat, salt and sugar content which while important, don't give the full nutritional information. Additionally, not everything has a bar code (especially healthier items like fresh vegetables) (https://mirandaswellness.com/2015/02/25/foodswitch-app-review/).

Overall, the majority of the reviewers were impressed by the features but discouraged by bugs or frustrating user interface elements of the design of the product. For example, a recipe book exists in the app but is difficult to find and/or not intuitive to use. Many of the negative reviews were something to the effect of “the app crashes when I...” or “when I try to use this feature, it doesn’t work the way I expected”. Almost all the apps had many comments of this nature. However, very few of the negative comments focused on a feature being non-existent, despite the range of features among the apps being very broad. We can improve on this by making our app as simple as possible by possibly offering fewer features but those we do offer must be very stable with intuitive user interfaces.

### Reflections on User Research

Rapid Ethnography: From the interview and the relative ease of use of Yummly, we've learned that although the app we tested was overall well received, avoiding redundancy of information is something that we cannot ignore, as our users will not. This makes our innovation focused mainly on how concisely we present our instructions, while leaving room for the optional ingredients and variations section we are planning.

Fly-on-the-wall: For the observation, the user was fluent in understanding the recipe and performing the cooking task. The user also gave clues to what downsides the cooking app possessed, though it is biased to a certain extent. Nevertheless, by using this information, we have a better understanding as to what to improve for our cooking app design. Nothing went poorly during the observation method, but what I would do differently, given more time, would be to observe additional users, mainly inexperienced cooks and to gain more insight on their perspectives.

Secondary Research: Reflecting on the secondary research technique, we were surprised both by the amount of things available in cooking apps and by the negative feedback about the quality of the software rather than the functionality of the software. One main weakness of secondary research is that there is a very large amount of material available and it can be difficult to get a comprehensive idea of what is available and what people's opinions are about it. To remedy this, we focused on the most relevant hits on google and assumed that this would be a good sample. Another weakness of this technique is that people can be biased when writing reviews of a product. To remedy this, we tried to look at as many reviews from different people as possible and look for trends.

## Task Descriptions

We designed three task descriptions for three different users.

1. Billy is nine, he wants to make a PB&J sandwhich, he is a smart kid who can operate a toaster safely. He has the ingredients already gathered for him as his dad just made him one a few hours ago.

2. Emily is a thirteen year old girl, she was raised on an ipad so she's very good with technology. She wants to make mac and cheese for some friends she's having over. Her mom has shown her how to cook this before but Emily can only remember the ingredients. She cannot remember all the steps. Her friends will be over in two hours.

3. Isabella is a twenty-one year old recent Immigrant to Canada from Spain who just got home from a long day at work and is very tired. She wants to cook something quick so she can eat and go to bed as fast as she can. She's only willing to use the ingredients she already has in her apartment.

4. Alex is a fifty year old professional chef, he wants to experiment with new dishes in his spare time, perhaps even modify the recipe in some way. He knows which ingredients he wants in this dish and which ingredients he wants nowhere near it, Alex knows exactly where to get any ingredients he may need. His computer skills are average, he can operate his PC at home with no problem.

5. Garrett is a a seventy year old retired man, he just had some groceries delivered to him at his home and he wants to cook something with them, Garrett is in rather good mental health but is a little forgetful sometimes.

6. Thomas is a 30 year old multi-millionaire CEO with a near-limitless budget. He's having a new girlfriend over to his mansion later and wants to be the one to cook for her so he sends his private chef home early, however after sending him off, he realized he doesn't know how to cook anything impressive. He's looking for a meal to impress, regardless of difficulty.
