# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Our Project is the Cooking Helper, it is an app that has its core based around being a cookbook, it's primary function is to provide our users with any recipe they need. On top of this, our app has other new features not found in other apps. Firstly, our app will have two search functions, one will be by recipe name, and the other by ingredients. Our ingredient search function will use two search bars, one for ingredients to include, one for ingredients to omit, to serve our users with restrictive diets better. Related to ingredients, should our user be missing any, we will provide a map to nearby stores which stock the respective missing ingredient. We expect our system to be used by anyone interested in cooking, whether experienced, or if they use our app to cook their first dish. We have kept this diversity within our clients in mind while designing this. We expect it to be used on mobile devices or laptops, and exclusively within a kitchen environment, again, the preparedness of the cook in their environment will vary user to user.

## Stakeholders and Users

Our stakeholders are first and foremost our users, their cooking experience is very much based on the quality of our system, and any changes we make will be primarily reflected through them. Secondly, we, the developers have a stake in this system as we put time and effort into it, as well as receiving the feedback for it. Other stakeholders include the store owners whose shops our app directs users to, as they will either see an increase or decrease in sales based on our success and inclusion of said store.

## User Research Methods

The three methods we chose were: Rapid ethnography, Fly-on-the-wall, and secondary research into other cooking apps and cooking instructions found on other platforms. We chose rapid ethnography and fly-on-the-wall for the same reason, we want to see the current state of users when they are interacting with available cooking helpers, to see if there is anything wrong with the current process, or if there is anything we could add that would significantly enhance the user experience. We chose our final method as secondary research because we feel it is very important, given the oversaturated cookbook industry, that we fully understand what is currently available, and the best way to do this is a simple dive into a search engine or app store.

I conducted one interview using the rapid ethnography method, I conducted this run with my little brother. I had him use the free app Yummly because it was the number two app on a "Best cooking app list" where number one wasn't free [1]. I had him choose the recipe he wanted to cook, and he chose Hot Dog, I asked him why he picked that and he said that he thought it would be the quickest and easiest thing to cook. He searched Hot Dog into the search function which must be accessed via a button ib the bottom of the screen, which he found almost immediately. After looking through his results, I asked him what he thought of them. He said he was very impressed by not only the amount of results but the variations between them. Eventually he scrolled back up and chose the first recipe on the list, which was titled "The Best Hot Dog", it was also the simplest looking one going by its picture according to our interviewee. it took him moments to gather the ingredients as they were very simple and immediately available (Buns, Weiner, and Condiments). Once the ingredients were gathered he clicked on the "View Directions" button, to which he noted that it was strange to have the directions and ingredients on two different pages. Once clicked, he was presented with an introductory few paragraphs, which weren't instructions but just background info on the dish. He noted that he was annoyed that he had to scroll through this unneccesary information about the dish before the recipe, once he reached the recipe, he noticed that the ingredients were listed again, and remarked on the unneccesity of the previous page. I prodded him to ask if the background info on the dish being placed after the recipe would have annoyed him less to which he responded yes, as then he could back out without having to go through it, as he said he would never read them. Cooking the dish was rather trivial and the directions were concise and easy to follow according to him. From this interview, we've learned that although the app we tested was overall well recieved, avoiding redundancy of information is something that we cannot ignore, as our users will not.

For the observation method(fly on the wall), I presented the user with a free existing cooking app, called “Food network: In the Kitchen”, within a tablet device and had the user pick a recipe and prepare it as I watched. Following the choosing of the recipe (a pasta dish), I noticed the user going over the ingredients page, and quickly organizing both available and non-specified ingredients. Since the user is a much older and a highly experienced cook, I also assumed the user being able to improvise and improve upon the recipe shown within the app. As a note, the given app didn’t contain extra suggestions or alternatives that would, in other cases, help or advise a novice cook. Similarly to the directions, the user was much more efficient with time management, mainly in the form of prepping. In this case, while the pasta and the sauce were cooking, the user chopped the necessary ingredients shortly before using them. Hence the user was able to finalize the recipe under 25 minutes, unlike the reported 35 minutes within the cooking app. Although the user is experienced, some time saving directives would've been useful for a novice user as well. Thus, we can also note that the recipe directions from the chosen app is obsolete in some aspects. I also remarked the user omitting a few ingredients and directions, with the reasoning of it being an unhealthy way of cooking and to consume based on their experiences. I also noticed that the user periodically looked at the directions during the cooking procedures. Following this observation, the user summarized that the app was satisfactory, but in need of improvements. Despite only observing a single user using this IDEO method, I can say that diverse users will approach and react differently to a recipe in this cooking app. Therefore, our design for a cooking app will implement additional forms of suggestions, which will help ease any complications towards the user, while also maintaining simplicity.

### Reflections on User Research

Fly-on-the-wall: For the observation, the user was fluent in understanding the recipe and performing the cooking task. The user also gave clues to what downsides the cooking app possessed, though it is bias to a certain extent. Nevertheless, by using this information, we have a better understanding as to what to improve for our cooking app design. Nothing went poorly during the observation method, but what I would do differently, given more time, would be to observe additional users, mainly inexperienced cooks and to gain more insight on their perspectives.
