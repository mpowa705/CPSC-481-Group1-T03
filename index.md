## Project Idea

![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image")

Our idea is for an app that would function primarily as a cookbook with many functions such as search by ingredient, omit ingredient, search by cooking time, rating recipes, as well as a user section where users could upload their own recipes. This would be available in a seperate section from our main cookbook due to inevitable inconsistencies in the quality of user-uploaded recipes. Our cookbook would also be unique as the recipes will include many optional steps, as well as recommended variations in ingredients and/or amount of each ingredient that would change the taste in a unique way. Our app would be available first on mobile, and later on on Mac/PC, we chose this ordering because mobile devices are the easiest to have around in a kitchen.
