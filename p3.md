For this task, we chose task description number 5 from P1, we begin by going into settings and setting the text size to large, since Garrett is elderly, he then searches the ingredients that he has had delivered to him, he picks a recipe and uses every resource available since he is forgetful. He watches all videos which are available on the same page. Once finished cooking, he does not feel like rating the recipe, so he closes out of it. He then logs out from the button in the top in the top right.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

We took our three heuristic evaluations and combined them, removing any repeated problems and agreeing on a score, this is what we came up with

### Combined Heuristics:
