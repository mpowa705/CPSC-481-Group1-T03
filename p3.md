For this task, we chose task description number 4 from P1, Alex does not have an account so he creates one, he then goes directly to search by recipe and fills in both the include and omit fields, he then chooses the dish he wants to cook and quickly throws it together using only the instructions, he is a professional chef so he has no need for videos. He then rates the recipe 5 stars. He then logs out from the button in the top in the top right.

For this task, we chose task description number 5 from P1, we begin by going into settings and setting the text size to large, since Garrett is elderly, he then searches the ingredients that he has had delivered to him, he picks a recipe and uses every resource available since he is forgetful. He watches all videos which are available on the same page. Once finished cooking, he does not feel like rating the recipe, so he closes out of it. He doesn't log out and simply locks his ipad.

For this task, we chose task description number 6 from P1, Thomas has used this app before so he goes into his cooking history, sorts it all by rating, and ensures that he picks a the highest star meal to impress the girl he's bringing over. He then breezes through the instructions since he's cooked this meal before. He enjoyed the result this time more than last time, so he changes the rating from 4 to 5 star once he's done. He then logs out from the button in the top right.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

We took our three heuristic evaluations and combined them, removing any repeated problems and agreeing on a score, this is what we came up with
