For this task, we chose task description number 4 from P1, Alex does not have an account so he creates one, during the creation he forgets to enter his email and the system warns him to fill all fields. He does and then logs in. he then goes directly to search by recipe and fills in both the include and omit fields, he then chooses the dish he wants to cook and quickly throws it together using only the instructions, he is a professional chef so he has no need for videos. He then rates the recipe 5 stars. He then logs out from the button in the top in the top right.

In this walkthrough our goal was to show the account creation process, as well as the fact that the login/creation pages have checks to see if all fields are filled. We then wanted to show that our search by ingredients functionality works with the omit fields filled as well.

For this task, we chose task description number 5 from P1, the user begins by logging in, and going into settings and setting the text size to large, since Garrett is elderly. His forgetfulness also leads him to the health tab to double check that his allergies are still correct. He then searches the ingredients that he has had delivered to him, he picks a recipe and uses every resource available since he is forgetful. He watches all videos which are available on the same page. Once finished cooking, he does not feel like rating the recipe, so he closes out of it. He doesn't log out and simply locks his ipad.

In this walkthrough we wanted to show both the settings and my health options in the profile tab, we also wanted to show that search by ingredient also works with only one of the fields filled. The cooking instructions are the same as the previous example so we don't show screenshots of that but Garrett does use the videos available. we also wanted to note that rating was completely optional, and that logging out wasn't necessary.

For this task, we chose task description number 6 from P1, Thomas has used this app before so he goes into his cooking history, sorts it all by rating, and ensures that he picks a the highest star meal to impress the girl he's bringing over. He then breezes through the instructions since he's cooked this meal before. He enjoyed the results a little less this time than last time, so he changes the rating from 5 to 4 star once he's done. He then logs out from the button in the top right.

In this walkthrough our goal was was to show that the search functions were not the only way to get to a recipe, it is also possible to access these recipes through your cooking history, another button in the settings tab. Again, same cooking instructions as the previous two so no images of that, but we wanted to show that it is possible to re-rate a recipe once you've finished cooking it again.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

We took our three heuristic evaluations and combined them, removing any repeated problems and agreeing on a score, this is what we came up with.

## Raw Heuristic Evaluation Notes

This are our three individual heuristic evaluations before combining them, we did these on our own time with no contact with the other members.
