## Revisions as requested:

### Page 4: 
The regular date and time we set was Wednesday before tutorial

### Page 5:

For the meet deadlines expectation: the deadlines are set dates that all members must agree on, and we see now that the consequence is unwise, failure to meet such dealines will be reflected in the peer review at the end of the term instead, with a stern talking to from the other members.

For the make quality work expectation, quality of one's work is based off of the judgement of the other 2 members, we must all come to a consensus before something is submitted.
