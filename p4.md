# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

This report is intended for the management of our design team, as well as potential investors. The app we designed was Cooking Helper, which functions primarily as a cookbook. Our design goals were to make this app as concise in information, robust, and innovative in an already oversaturated market. We first conducted three user-research methods which were Rapid Ethnography, Fly-On-the-Wall, and Secondary Research. From these we learnt that preventing redundancy in our information was a necessity, and that the interface design was crucial to the success of our app. In the end, our design was finalized as the images shown in P3. In our heuristic evaluation we found 3 critical errors that must be addressed, namely documentation, the function of the back button, and input checking. We also have solutions planned for these issues. 

## Introduction

Before designing our app, we were well aware that there were plenty of other cooking apps that we would have to compete with. However, we felt up to the challenge. Having had experiences with previous cooking apps ourselves we knew that there was still room for innovation. Our goal here, therefore, was a chellenging one as these innovations to be made weren't immediately clear. We used a few HCI methods to learn of these issues within current apps on the market, as well as issues within our own app's iterations.

## Design Problem

We established four main design problems, 

How can we innovate in an already oversaturated cooking app market?
  With a great deal of other cooking apps available, we had to delve deep into this market and find any room for innovation that we could, our user research was very helpful in this regard.

How can we make the app as clear and as concise as possible?
  From our user research we also learned that a lack of clarity or unecessary information was a large crutch on many cooking apps currently available on the market.

How can we teach people to cook efficiently at all skill levels and ages?
  From some of the apps we saw, they have robust interfaces but aren't very intuitive or child-friendly. We would like to accomodate that in our app.

Keeping the app minimalistic and user-friendly.
  This design goal we derived from our second one, if we are avoiding redundancy of information we should also strive to avoid cluttering the user interface as well.

## Design and Justification

Here is an image of our final recipe page, which we will now justify.

This page is organized as it is so that all the information is immediately available, while still keeping clutter to a minimum to make the buttons clickable. We chose to have everything on one page as we learned from Yummly that having information seperated is a huge detriment to a cookbook app. Our tab design is as it is because we wanted our app split between search bars and personalization only. Any other tabs aren't directly useful to the user so we kept it limited.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

In our heuristic evaluation we found a few
