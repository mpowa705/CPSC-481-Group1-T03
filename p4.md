## Cooking Helper
#### Niroojen Thambimuthu, Matthew Powaschuk, John Hall

## Executive Summary

This report is intended for the management of our design team, as well as potential investors. The app we designed was Cooking Helper, which functions primarily as a cookbook. Our design goals were to make this app as concise in information, robust, and innovative in an already oversaturated market. We first conducted three user-research methods which were Rapid Ethnography, Fly-On-the-Wall, and Secondary Research. From these we learnt that preventing redundancy in our information was a necessity, and that the interface design was crucial to the success of our app. In the end, our design was finalized as the images shown in P3. In our heuristic evaluation we found 3 critical errors that must be addressed, namely: Documentation, the unusual function of the back button, and input checking. We already have solutions planned for these issues. 

## Introduction

Before designing our app, we were well aware that there were plenty of other cooking apps that we would have to compete with. However, we felt up to the challenge. Having had experiences with previous cooking apps ourselves we knew that there was still room for innovation. Our goal here, therefore, was a chellenging one as these innovations to be made weren't immediately clear. We used a few HCI methods to learn of these issues within current apps on the market, as well as issues within our own app's iterations. We will dive into these methods in depth for the rest of the report.

## Design Problem

We established four main design problems, 

How can we innovate in an already oversaturated cooking app market?
  With a great deal of other cooking apps available, we had to delve deep into this market and find any room for innovation that we could, our user research was very helpful in this regard.

How can we make the app as clear and as concise as possible?
  From our user research we also learned that a lack of clarity or unecessary information was a large crutch on many cooking apps currently available on the market.

How can we teach people to cook efficiently at all skill levels and ages?
  From some of the apps we saw, they have robust interfaces but aren't very intuitive or child-friendly. We would like to accomodate that in our app.

Keeping the app minimalistic and user-friendly.
  This design goal we derived from our second one, if we are avoiding redundancy of information we should also strive to avoid cluttering the user interface as well. 

## User Research and Findings

The three methods we chose were: Rapid ethnography, Fly-on-the-wall, and secondary research into other cooking apps and cooking instructions found on other platforms. We chose rapid ethnography and fly-on-the-wall for the same reason, we want to see the current state of users when they are interacting with available cooking helpers, to see if there is anything wrong with the current process, or if there is anything we could add that would significantly enhance the user experience. We chose our final method as secondary research because we feel it is very important, given the oversaturated cookbook industry, that we fully understand what is currently available, and the best way to do this is a simple dive into a search engine or app store.

### Methods:

#### Rapid Ethnography:

An interview was conducted using the rapid ethnography method, this run was conducted with Matt's eighteen year old little brother, who is a rather inexperienced cook. He was using the free app Yummly because it was the number two app on a "Best cooking app list" where number one wasn't free. He chose his own recipe, which ended up being a Hot Dog and he gave us his thoughts as he cooked.

#### Fly-on-the-Wall:

This method was conducted by Niroojen with his mother. For the method, the user was shown a free cooking app, called “Food Network: In the Kitchen”, on a tablet device and the user had to pick a recipe and prepare it as Niroojen watched.

#### Secondary Research:

This method was conducted by John, to gain some insight into what is available with regards to current cooking apps, we conducted some secondary research to see what kinds of apps are available, what features they offer and browsed reviews of the app.

The apps examined were: BigOven, Food Network in the Kitchen, Allrecipes Dinner Spinner, Side Chef, Epicurious Recipe & Food Videos, and FoodSwitch.

### Findings:

#### Rapid Ethnography:

General quality of competitors
  Yummly's interface quality was almost mindblowing, it look beautiful to the eyes and is easy to navigate. Clearly, if we are to compete in this market, our 

Redundancy of information
  The only problem with Yummly that my tester pointed out was that there was a lot of useless information before the instructions were available. As we imagine our app being potentially used in a commercial fast-paced kitchen, we find that removing this information would be an all-around improvement.

#### Fly-on-the-Wall:

The tested app obsolete in some aspects
  Some of the information and tabs were utterly useless, such as recipe history and other information that is simply not necessary. The findings here are similar to Rapid Ethnography.

Diverse users will approach and react differently to recipes.
  The recipes here are designed to be accessible to all users, we should strive to hit this goal as well.

#### Secondary Research:

Users generally impressed by features of app
  Even though some features aren't entirely necessary, as long as they don't get in the way of cooking (like it did in the Yummly app), users generally enjoy more features.

Easily frustrated by bugs and bad interface design
  This represents the most prevalent problem among users, a bad interface. This makes improving the look of cooking apps our top priority.

None of them expressed a desire for a missing feature
  No reviews found suggested an additional feature, meaning either that nothing additional was necessary, or that it wasn't something that the users immediately felt necessary. As a result, the new functions we add will be kept to a minimum and we chose to focus instead on concentrating information and improving on existing interfaces.

## Design and Justification

Here is an image of our final recipe page, which we will now justify.

This page is organized as it is so that all the information is immediately available, while still keeping clutter to a minimum to make the buttons clickable. We chose to have everything on one page as we learned from Yummly that having information seperated is a huge detriment to a cookbook app. Our tab design is as it is because we wanted our app split between search bars and personalization only. Any other tabs aren't directly useful to the user so we kept it limited.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

In our heuristic evaluation we found more than a few violations, see the full list here:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpowa705/mpowa705.github.io/master/images/combinedheuristic.png "Combined Heuristics")

However, for now, we focused on three of the most major violations we could find in our evaluation. These being:

Lack of documentation
  Our app does not have any documentation to explain the functionalities of our app, leaving new or technically incompetent users in the dust. As one of our goals is accomodating as many users as possible, this error must be addressed.

Change in functionality on the back button
  Our back button does not function like most, it takes you straight back to the search page rather than the previous page, this would be incredibly frustrating for users and needs to be addressed.

Lack of input checking
  This is a problem that arises from users being able to search non-ingredients in the search bar and add any text as an allergy, this may confuse users and we intend to fix this on future iterations.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

In the next iteration, we have proposed solutions to each of the previous three errors.

### Lack of Documentation

On a later iteration we would add short, simple explanations for terms brought up by a "?" Button, rather than a full help page. This button would show a short snippet of text explaining whatever the button is relevant to. 

### Functionality of the Back Button

Make the button more consistent with most apps, where the back button simply takes you to a previous page.

### Lack of Input Checking.

Provide error checking consistent with the description of each text box. Check if allergy is a known ingredient or ingredient-group (grains), check if email contains @ sign, etc…

## Conclusions

In the end our methods proved very productive, as we were able to create a usable prototype and already plan improvements on it. The user research gave us many insights into what aspects of our app we should focus on developing over others, such as focusing on keeping information on one page and keeping it all visible. Once our heuristic evaluations were done, we were able to evaluate problems in our system much more effectively using this organized method. In the end both these methods helped us develop our app to accomplish our design problems in the most user-friendly way. Although we see much potential in our app, the heuristic evaluations show that there is still much room for improvement before our development is finished.
