# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

This report is intended for the management of our design team, as well as potential investors. The app we designed was Cooking Helper, which functions primarily as a cookbook. Our design goals were to make this app as concise in information, robust, and innovative in an already oversaturated market. We first conducted three user-research methods which were Rapid Ethnography, Fly-On-the-Wall, and Secondary Research. From these we learnt that preventing redundancy in our information was a necessity, and that the interface design was crucial to the success of our app. In the end, our design was finalized as the images shown in P3. In our heuristic evaluation we found 3 critical errors that must be addressed, namely documentation, the function of the back button, and input checking. We also have solutions planned for these issues. 

## Introduction

Before designing our app, we were well aware that there were plenty of other cooking apps that we would have to compete with. However, we felt up to the challenge. Having had experiences with previous cooking apps ourselves we knew that there was still room for innovation. Our goal here, therefore, was a chellenging one as these innovations to be made weren't immediately clear. We used a few HCI methods to learn of these issues within current apps on the market, as well as issues within our own app's iterations.

## Design Problem

We established four main design problems, 

How can we innovate in an already oversaturated cooking app market?
  With a great deal of other cooking apps available, we had to delve deep into this market and find any room for innovation that we could, our user research was very helpful in this regard.

How can we make the app as clear and as concise as possible?
  From our user research we also learned that a lack of clarity or unecessary information was a large crutch on many cooking apps currently available on the market.

How can we teach people to cook efficiently at all skill levels and ages?
  From some of the apps we saw, they have robust interfaces but aren't very intuitive or child-friendly. We would like to accomodate that in our app.

Keeping the app minimalistic and user-friendly.
  This design goal we derived from our second one, if we are avoiding redundancy of information we should also strive to avoid cluttering the user interface as well. 

## User Research and Findings

The three methods we chose were: Rapid ethnography, Fly-on-the-wall, and secondary research into other cooking apps and cooking instructions found on other platforms. We chose rapid ethnography and fly-on-the-wall for the same reason, we want to see the current state of users when they are interacting with available cooking helpers, to see if there is anything wrong with the current process, or if there is anything we could add that would significantly enhance the user experience. We chose our final method as secondary research because we feel it is very important, given the oversaturated cookbook industry, that we fully understand what is currently available, and the best way to do this is a simple dive into a search engine or app store.

### Findings:

#### Rapid Ethnography:

General quality of competitors
  Yummly's interface quality was almost mindblowing, it look beautiful to the eyes and is easy to navigate. Clearly, if we are to compete in this market, our 

Redundancy of information
  The only problem with Yummly that my tester pointed out was that there was a lot of useless information before the instructions were available. As we imagine our app being potentially used in a commercial fast-paced kitchen, we find that removing this information would be an all-around improvement.

#### Fly-on-the-Wall:

Tested app obsolete in some aspects

Diverse users will approach and react differently to recipes.

#### Secondary Research:

Users generally impressed by features of app

Easily frustrated by bugs and bad interface design

None of them expressed a desire for a missing feature

## Design and Justification

Here is an image of our final recipe page, which we will now justify.

This page is organized as it is so that all the information is immediately available, while still keeping clutter to a minimum to make the buttons clickable. We chose to have everything on one page as we learned from Yummly that having information seperated is a huge detriment to a cookbook app. Our tab design is as it is because we wanted our app split between search bars and personalization only. Any other tabs aren't directly useful to the user so we kept it limited.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

In our heuristic evaluation we found more than a few violations, see the full list here:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpowa705/mpowa705.github.io/master/images/combinedheuristic.png "Combined Heuristics")

However, for now, we focused on three of the most major violations we could find on there. These being:

Lack of documentation

Change in functionality on the back button

Lack of input checking

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

In the next iteration, we have proposed solutions to each of the previous three errors.

### Lack of Documentation

On a later iteration we would add short, simple explanations for terms brought up by a ? Button, rather than a full help page. 

### Functionality of the Back Button

Make the button more consistent with most apps, where the back button simply takes you to a previous page.

### Lack of Input Checking.

Provide error checking consistent with the description of each text box. Check if allergy is a known ingredient or ingredient-group (grains), check if email contains @ sign, etcâ€¦

## Conclusions

In the end our methods proved very productive, as we were able to create a usable prototype and already plan improvements on it. Although we see much potential in our app, the heuristic evaluations show that there is still much room for improvement before our development is finished.
