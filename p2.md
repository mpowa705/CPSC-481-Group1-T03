# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

We recorded our video prototype during lab time. The task we attempt to accomplish is to find and go through a recipe that uses ingredients chicken and onion, while omitting beef and peppers.

The task we picked for this video prototype was Alex's from P1, which goes as follows.

_Alex is a fifty year old professional chef, he wants to experiment with new dishes in his spare time, perhaps even modify the recipe in some way. He knows which ingredients he wants in this dish and which ingredients he wants nowhere near it, Alex knows exactly where to get any ingredients he may need. His computer skills are average, he can operate his PC at home with no problem._

We chose this task because we wanted to prototype the search by ingredient with both the _Ingredients to omit_ and _Ingredients to include_ fields filled.

The task we chose to create this storyboard around was also Alex's from P1, we wanted to illustrate how he would go through searching our app and choosing a recipe that fits his likes and dislikes.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

The task description from P1 that we chose was Emily's, it goes as follows

_Emily is a thirteen year old girl, she was raised on an ipad so she's very good with technology. She wants to make mac and cheese for some friends she's having over. Her mom has shown her how to cook this before but Emily can only remember the ingredients. She cannot remember all the steps. Her friends will be over in two hours._

This is the walkthrough that we did based on her goal.

In terms of any tasks from P1 that needed changing, only the detail of Isabella having poor english language skills was removed, as we did not find that relevant and our app does not account for that.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

From these sketches we took the following ideas: Video, Community recipes, Health, Login, Search by recipe, Search by ingredients, Omit ingredient, cooking history, rate recipes, allergies, images, Audio guidance.

We then split these ideas into 3 groups in an affinity diagram. The groups being: 

1. Profile, for all ideas related to a specific user's personalized experience.
2. Search, for all ideas related to a specialized search function.
3. Instruction, for all ideas related to the core of the app, the cooking instructions.

This is the affinity diagram we drew up:

Splitting the ideas into these categories helped us design our tabs that you saw in the video prototype, and made our app design easier to navigate.


## Reflection

During our ideation process, we found the brainstorming portion the most engaging, we had ideas flowing and were able to go from many wild unrealistic ideas to something doable, simply by taking parts of each. The video prototype was also very helpful as we were forced to make a visible UI on paper, which will be a reference point when we are building our vertical prototype within Axure. When building this paper prototype, our affinity diagram helped us place our tabs and content within the page. In terms of future plans, the Task-centered system walkthrough gave us a lot of improvements to make. Having to think about the interaction in depth step by step, made us realize some things weren't as intuitive as we thought they were in our original plans.

One section that we feel didn't bring as much to our ideation as the rest was the storyboard, it did bring us an idea of how a user would interact with our system, but the paper prototype we made with our video gives us a better idea of this, as at any time we can practice an interaction much more quickly. If we could do this again, we might minimize the storyboard portion to simple sketches, and perform many more task-centered system walkthroughs to find more design problems faster.
